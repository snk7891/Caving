Caving
======

*A Bukkit/Minecraft (aka server-side only) plugin for quick and scary games*

What's the most boring stuff in Minecraft? Oh it's easy: branch mining!
And what's instead thrilling? Caving!

If you're like me, then you'll probably like this Bukkit plugin: **Caving**.
It's an attempt to make Survival mode a little bit more challenging without going too far from Vanilla Minecraft.

At the moment it's tuned for a team for 2-6 people playing together and aiming at killing the dragon, but if it will be appreciated, I would work on a new, improved and more customizable version, suitable for a greater number of participants.

So what's happening here? Following is a list of all the changes I applied with this plugin.

## Misc enhancements
- You cannot brew Fire Resistance potions, making the nether more dangerous
- You cannot wear pumpkins, making the End more dangerous

## Empowered enemies
- **Skeletons** could sometimes spawn as a frightening variant, throwing explosive arrows at you. You can recognize them because they always wear mail helmets.
- **Zombies** could sometimes spawn stronger than the normal, performing really dangerous melee attacks. They wear mail helmets too.
- **Spiders** can paralyze, making you unable to move or jump for a few seconds. Hope there's no creeper around..
- **Witches** can sometimes throw dangerous harm potions to you
- Charged **creepers** can sometimes spawn naturally
- **Ghasts** can sometimes create lava with their projectiles
- **Endermen** can spawn as a "gorgone" version, which makes you blind and confused for a few seconds on aggro. This kind of Enderman could drop ender pearls, while standard ones could drop diamonds instead (so it's better to search for pearls in the huts - see below)
- **Wither skeletons** now applies a wither effect that lasts longer
- **Pigmen** works as always, but they can drop diamonds, so... what about killing some of them to make that chest you really want?
- **Blazes** are the same, but remember, you cannot brew fire res potions
- **Silverfishes** are not changed either, but they are a frequent encounter in warriors' huts (see below)
Finally, the **ender dragon** now can gain health from the damage he causes to players

## New combat mechanics
- **Sneaky attacks**: beware of this insidious attack that comes with no warning! A single zombie, skeleton or witch can spawn really close to you, even during the day! That's scary..
- **Ambush**: sometimes you will heard a noise behind you... that's probably an ambush! Now you have just a few seconds to prepare yourself to defend against a team of angry skeletons, zombies and endermen.. or you will die!

## Warrior's Huts
In *naturally generated* caves, you will find easily the mysterious **huts**. These are easy-recognizable cobblestone buildings which contain a chest filled with useful stuff (armors, weapons, tools, enchantment books, ...even food!) and also ender pearls. You will have to search for them if you want to proceed to the dragon, but beware of the dangerous mob spawners inside.

## For developers

This is my first plugin, so be patient. It's not the most efficient one and it contains several bugs (I am aware of this); I will probably find some time to improve it in the future.
Nevertheless, I think it was a good way to start, because I explored many aspects of bukkit development, so I am proud of it in some ways.
